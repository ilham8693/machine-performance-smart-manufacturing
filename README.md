## Problem Background
In manufacturing, efficient production is essential for maximizing output, quality, and cost savings. Energy use is a major expense, while quality, sustainability, and waste reduction are key Industry 4.0 priorities. Analyzing historical data helps identify improvement opportunities, and using statistical analysis and visualization enables data-driven decisions to optimize processes for smarter, greener manufacturing.

## Project Output
The project outcomes include detailed visualization graphs displayed through dashboards, complemented by statistical analyses and calculations centered on machine performance metrics. These insights provide a solid foundation for informed decision-making and guide targeted actions aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the production process.

## Data
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle.com and is intended for smart manufacturing practice, his dataset offers a comprehensive snapshot of smart manufacturing operations, emphasizing sustainability and process optimization. Provided in CSV format, it contains 10,000 rows and 9 columns with no missing values. List of the colomns:
- Timestamp - String
- Machine ID - String
- Material Category - String
- Material Name - String
- Quantity Used - Float
- Recycled Material - Float
- Energy Consumption - Float
- Production Output (Units) - Integer
- Defect Rate (%) - Float

## Method
This project employs a combination of data visualization techniques using Python and Tableau, along with comprehensive descriptive and inferential statistical analyses conducted in Python to discover meaningful insights from the data.

## Stacks
The programming language, tools, and Python libraries utilized in this project, including:
- Pandas (`import pandas as pd`) – used for data manipulation and analysis, especially in tabular form (DataFrame), such as reading, cleaning, and analyzing data.
- SciPy Stats (`from scipy import stats` and `from scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis`) – used for performing statistical analysis, including the calculation of skewness (asymmetry of distribution) and kurtosis (peakedness of distribution).
- Matplotlib Pyplot (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`) – used for data visualization through graphs or plots such as histograms, line plots, and scatter plots.
