    "In the manufacturing industry, production processes are critical to achieving maximum output with high quality and low operational costs. Energy consumption is a major cost driver in manufacturing operations and plays a significant role in overall efficiency. Moreover, good product quality with low defect, sustainability and waste reduction have become key focuses in Industry 4.0. By studying historical operational data, companies can identify patterns and opportunities to enhance performance. With statistical analysis and data visualization, data-driven decisions can be made to optimize production processes, making them smarter, more efficient, and environmentally friendly."

The result above, Skewness is very close to 0, which means the distribution is approximately symmetric, or close to normal. Since it's slightly negative, the left tail might be slightly longer, but the skewness is so small it's practically negligible. A negative kurtosis (less than 0) indicates fewer outliers, so no need to conduct further outlier handling."

It means M008 has best performance among all in term of saving energy. Based on this analysis others machine should refer to M008 performance esspecialy M005. In that case the reduction possibility from `Energy Consumption` for M005 is 3.75%. To do that can do benchmarking against M008 and conduct technical peformance comparison such as Operating conditions, Maintenance schedules, Load capacity and usage patterns, Component wear or calibration settings."

Based on this analysis others machine should refer to M007 performance esspecialy M005. In that case the reduction possibility from `Defect` for M005 is 4.37%. To do that can do benchmarking against M007 and conduct technical peformance comparison such as Operating conditions, Maintenance schedules, Load capacity and usage patterns, Component wear or calibration settings."

    "Based on the analysis of the dataset, several key insights were obtained to support process optimization and energy efficiency in the manufacturing environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Outlier analysis revealed `Energy consumption` and `defect` data is approximately normally distributed with minimal skew and low outlier presence, so no further outlier handling is necessary. `Energy consumption Skewness: -0.01, Kurtosis: -1.19` and `Defect Skewness: -0.03, Kurtosis: -1.19`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Machine Performance for `M007` has the `highest` total production output, while `M008` has the `lowest`, based on the bar chart visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For total energy consumption, based on the bar chart, Machine `M007` has the `highest` total energy consumption, while `M008` has the `lowest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Machine `M008` has the best average energy efficiency, suggesting other machines especially `M005`, which could potentially reduce energy use by 3.75% should benchmark against `M008` through technical performance comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Machine `M007` has the best defect performance, so other machines—particularly `M005`, which could reduce defects by 4.37%—should benchmark against `M007` through technical performance evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Correlation Analysis tells that here is `no meaningful correlation` between `product output` and either `energy consumption` or `defect count`, indicating that production output do not significantly influence these factors. `Energy Consumption r-correlation: -0.0017` and `Defect r-correlation: 0.0092`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Based on inferential Analysis by `Machine ID`, Machines show `significant` differences in `energy consumption` but `not` in `defect` rates, suggesting optimization efforts should focus on aligning all machines with the most energy-efficient one while considering external factors for defects. `Energy Consumption P-value: 0.0404` and `Defect, P-value: 0.6909`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis shows that energy consumption and defect data are normally distributed with minimal outliers. Machine M007 leads in less defect performance, while M008 is the most energy efficient. Significant differences exist in energy consumption across machines but not in defect rates, indicating optimization should focus on energy efficiency benchmarking, especially improving machines like M005 by referencing M007 and M008.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations: To improve smart manufacturing in the factory, it is recommended to benchmark energy efficiency and defect performance using the best performing machines. By analyzing and adopting their operating conditions, maintenance schedules, load capacities, and component settings. Implementing real-time monitoring, standardizing operating parameters, and training staff on best practices will support continuous optimization. Leveraging data-driven decision-making will help maintain these benchmarks and drive ongoing enhancements in productivity, cost efficiency, and product quality."
